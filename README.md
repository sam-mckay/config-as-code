Simple repository to test shipping custom docker images built from Jenkins LTS image 

This utilises Jenkins Config as Code to create a custom docker container with my Jenkins config and plugins pre installed, allowing for easy deployment, recreation, and testing of my Jenkins setup

It also uses github actions to build & deploy the image
